  "summary": "The diff implements REQ-30 fully. MembersPage.tsx is refactored to include a 'Download Database' button in the page header area alongside the page title, styled consistently with the app's design system using Button component and lucide-react icons. The button triggers a client-side CSV download using already-fetched member data with all required columns: Membership Number, Name, Mobile No, Alternate Mobile, Address, Area, Spouse Name, Family Member Count. The button is disabled only during initial loading, remaining visible in all states (empty, loading, populated). No backend changes were made.",
