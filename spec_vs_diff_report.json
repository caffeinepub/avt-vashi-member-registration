  "summary": "The diff modifies backend/main.mo and project_state.json. The backend file shows the addMember function with its correct access control check using AccessControl.hasPermission. However, the diff is truncated and does not show the bulkAddMembers function or its access control fix. Based on the truncated diff, we cannot confirm whether the bulkAddMembers function's access control was actually fixed.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-44",
      "requirement": "Fix the bulkAddMembers access control check so it uses the same principal/identity validation logic as addMember (AccessControl.hasPermission with #user permission), allowing authenticated non-anonymous principals while rejecting anonymous callers.",
      "reason": "The diff is truncated and does not show the bulkAddMembers function body. The addMember function is visible and uses 'AccessControl.hasPermission(accessControlState, caller, #user)' but the bulkAddMembers function with its (presumably fixed) access control check is cut off in the truncated content. There is no evidence in the shown diff that the bulkAddMembers function was actually modified to align its check with addMember.",
